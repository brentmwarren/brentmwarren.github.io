Technologies:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Your process/approach:
I chose to get my structure for html and css in place before adding content. This allowed me to add content quite easily.

Unsolved problems:
paralaxing and side-by-side text and pictures
resume
because of the bootstrap header, when i jump to a page it isnt quite centered where i want it
lots of css tweaking

Your biggest wins and challenges:
biggest wins was getting css that flowed properly and was re-usable.
